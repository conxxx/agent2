[2025-05-16 20:51:00] - Recent Changes: Implemented agent-triggered cart refresh functionality.
    - Agent tools (`agents/customer-service/customer_service/tools/tools.py`) updated to potentially return `{"action": "refresh_cart"}`.
    - Streaming Server (`agents/customer-service/streaming_server.py`) updated to send a WebSocket command `{"type": "command", "command_name": "refresh_cart"}`.
    - Agent Widget (`cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/agent_widget.js`) updated to relay this command via `window.parent.postMessage`.
    - Main Page (`cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/script.js`) updated to listen for this `postMessage` and trigger cart re-fetch/re-render.
[2025-05-16 20:51:00] - Current Focus: Updating Memory Bank to reflect agent-triggered cart refresh feature completion.
[2025-05-16 20:51:00] - Key Learnings & Patterns:
    - The existing agent-to-frontend communication pattern (WebSocket -> iframe `postMessage` -> main page listener) is reusable for various agent-initiated UI updates, now including cart refresh.
[2025-05-16 20:51:00] - Next Steps: Evaluate further tasks now that agent-triggered cart refresh is complete.
[2025-05-16 20:22:53] - Recent Changes: Implemented agent-controlled website night mode.
    - Agent: New `set_website_theme` tool, updated prompts in `agents/customer-service/`.
    - Frontend: CSS variables (`.night-mode` in `style.css`), JavaScript `applyTheme` function and `localStorage` in `script.js`.
    - Communication: Updates to `streaming_server.py`, `agent_widget.js` (`postMessage`), and `script.js` (message listener).
[2025-05-16 20:22:53] - Current Focus: Updating Memory Bank to reflect night mode feature completion.
[2025-05-16 20:22:53] - Key Learnings & Patterns:
    - CSS custom properties enable dynamic theming.
    - `localStorage` provides client-side theme persistence.
    - Agent-to-frontend communication for UI changes can be achieved via WebSocket -> iframe `postMessage` -> main page listener.
[2025-05-16 20:22:53] - Next Steps: Evaluate further tasks now that agent-controlled night mode is complete.
[2025-05-12 22:16:00] - Recent Changes: Debugged and fixed Retail API integration issues in `app.py` and `test_api.py`.
[2025-05-12 22:16:00] - Current Focus: Finalizing Retail API debugging task.

[2025-05-12 22:41:00] - Recent Changes: Investigated and addressed 404 errors for the `check_product_availability` tool. The backend API at `/api/products/availability/...` now correctly returns a 404 for non-existent products.
[2025-05-12 22:41:00] - Current Focus: Finalizing documentation of the `check_product_availability` fix.

[2025-05-12 22:50:48] - Recent Changes: Modified `agents/customer-service/customer_service/prompts.py` to add a more explicit instruction for the agent to proactively use the `access_cart_information` tool before making recommendations or asking the user about their cart. Updated `decisionLog.md`.
[2025-05-12 22:50:48] - Current Focus: Finalizing documentation of the prompt update for cart access debugging.

[2025-05-12 23:02:55] - Recent Changes: Added `search_products` tool to `tools.py` and `agent.py`. Updated `prompts.py` to instruct agent to use the new tool for product searches and clarified usage of `get_product_recommendations`. Updated `decisionLog.md`.
[2025-05-12 23:02:55] - Current Focus: Finalizing documentation of the new search tool and prompt updates.

[2025-05-12 23:11:20] - Recent Changes: Updated `agents/customer-service/customer_service/prompts.py` to instruct the agent to ask clarifying questions (quantity, variety) after product search and before adding to cart, and to offer accessory recommendations after a plant is added to cart. Updated `decisionLog.md`.
[2025-05-12 23:11:20] - Current Focus: Finalizing documentation of the prompt updates for improved interaction flow.

[2025-05-12 23:38:15] - Recent Changes: Refined agent prompts in `prompts.py` for smoother cart access (silent checks) and updated `get_product_recommendations` tool in `tools.py` to fetch specific product IDs from a primary product's attributes. Updated `prompts.py` to guide the agent on this new recommendation flow. Updated `decisionLog.md`.
[2025-05-12 23:38:15] - Current Focus: Finalizing documentation of the refined recommendation logic and cart interaction flow.

[2025-05-12 23:40:30] - Recent Changes: Updated `prompts.py` to instruct the agent to offer care instructions after adding a plant to the cart and to offer planting services post-purchase. Updated `decisionLog.md`.
[2025-05-12 23:40:30] - Current Focus: Finalizing documentation of the updated post-add and post-purchase agent flows.

[2025-05-13 00:13:40] - Recent Changes: User successfully started `adk web` from `agents/customer-service/` with `--session_db_url sqlite:///customer_service/adk_sessions.db`. `DatabaseSessionService` initialized correctly.
[2025-05-13 00:13:40] - Current Focus: Awaiting user confirmation on whether the original "Session not found" error for voice/video is resolved.

[2025-05-13 23:03:00] - Recent Changes: Successfully resolved issues with ADK agent voice and video features in the custom widget.
    - Refactored `cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/agent_widget.js` to implement WebSocket communication and Web Audio API (AudioWorklets) for voice, based on ADK "Custom Audio Streaming app" tutorial.
    - Created helper JS modules: `pcm-player-processor.js`, `pcm-recorder-processor.js`, `audio-modules.js` in `cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/js/`.
    - Updated `cymbal_home_garden_backend/templates/agent_widget.html` to load `agent_widget.js` as a module.
    - Changed ADK agent model in `agents/customer-service/customer_service/config.py` to `gemini-2.0-flash-live-preview-04-09` (after `gemini-2.0-flash-live-001` was not found).
    - Downgraded `websockets` Python library from `15.0.1` to `13.0.0` to resolve `TypeError: BaseEventLoop.create_connection() got an unexpected keyword argument 'extra_headers'` that occurred with Python 3.12.9 when video was enabled. This version (`13.0.0`) is compatible with `google-generativeai==1.14.0`.
[2025-05-13 23:03:00] - Current Focus: Voice and video features for the customer service agent are now functional. Pending further testing on video stream quality and robustness. Memory bank updated.
[2025-05-13 23:03:00] - Key Learnings & Patterns:
    - ADK Live API requires specific "Live" compatible Gemini models.
    - Custom client-side ADK voice/video integration relies on WebSockets and Web Audio API, not a monolithic ADK Client SDK for this part.
    - Python package version compatibility (esp. `websockets` with `google-generativeai` and Python's `asyncio`) is critical and can cause subtle runtime errors like the `extra_headers` issue. Pinning `websockets` to `13.0.0` was key.
    - The WebSocket URL for custom clients connecting to `adk web` might differ from ADK's FastAPI examples and needs to match the `run_live` endpoint structure if that's what `adk web` exposes.

[2025-05-14 22:46:00] - Recent Changes: Successfully integrated the customer service agent widget into the main Cymbal Home Garden e-commerce website, resolving session creation and WebSocket connectivity issues through a Node.js proxy server.
    - **HTTP Session Creation (Resolving 405 Error):**
        - Modified `cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/agent_widget.js` to send `body: undefined` and no `Content-Type` header for the session creation `fetch` POST request, aligning with ADK Dev UI behavior.
        - Replaced `http-proxy-middleware` for the `/apps/**` path in `proxy-server.js` with a manual proxy implementation using the native `http` module. This ensured the correctly formatted request reached the ADK server, which responded with `200 OK`.
    - **WebSocket Connection:**
        - Updated `proxy-server.js` to explicitly handle the `upgrade` event on its HTTP server, delegating WebSocket upgrade requests for `/run_live` to `http-proxy-middleware`'s `wsProxy.upgrade` method. This enabled successful WebSocket connections.
    - **CORS Handling:**
        - Configured the `cors` middleware in `proxy-server.js` to dynamically allow origins `http://localhost:5000` and `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
[2025-05-14 22:46:00] - Current Focus: Core communication channel (HTTP session creation and WebSocket) for the agent widget is now established and functional through the proxy. Text chat functionality is presumed to be working but was not explicitly tested by Cline in this session. User opted to move to a new task.
[2025-05-14 22:46:00] - Key Learnings & Patterns:
    - `http-proxy-middleware` can sometimes exhibit unexpected behavior (like not invoking `onProxyReq` or potentially generating its own 405 responses) for specific request patterns (e.g., POST with empty body to a proxied path). Switching to a manual proxy for the problematic HTTP route provided more control and resolved the issue.
    - Explicitly handling the `server.on('upgrade', ...)` event is crucial for `http-proxy-middleware` to correctly proxy WebSockets when used with an existing Express HTTP server.
    - Browsers treat `http://localhost:PORT` and `http://127.0.0.1:PORT` as distinct origins for CORS purposes.
    - Iterative debugging of proxy logs (both client-side and proxy-side) is essential to pinpoint discrepancies in request/response headers and bodies.

[2025-05-15 20:21:00] - Recent Changes: Applied user-provided fix for `AttributeError: 'LiveServerContent' object has no attribute 'text'` in `agents/customer-service/streaming_server.py` by updating `agent_to_client_messaging` to handle various event types from ADK's `runner.run_live` more robustly. Also updated `cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/agent_widget.js` to send an initial greeting message on WebSocket open.
[2025-05-15 20:21:00] - Current Focus: Finalizing documentation of the `LiveServerContent` AttributeError fix.

[2025-05-15 22:03:00] - Recent Changes: Updated `websocket.onmessage` in `cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/agent_widget.js` to correctly process status messages (e.g., `{"status":"turn_complete"}`) received from the streaming server. Previously, these messages were being logged as "unhandled mime_type" because they lack a `mime_type` field, and the client was not displaying agent text responses. The fix ensures status messages are handled first, and then content messages with `mime_type` are processed.
[2025-05-15 22:03:00] - Current Focus: Finalizing documentation for the client-side `onmessage` handler fix.

[2025-05-15 22:08:00] - Recent Changes: Aligned server-side (`streaming_server.py`) and client-side (`agent_widget.js`) event handling with "Custom Audio Streaming app.md" example. Server now sends status (turn_complete, interrupted, interaction_completed) as boolean flags in a JSON object and `continue`s processing. Client now checks for these boolean flags before checking for `mime_type`.
[2025-05-15 22:08:00] - Current Focus: Finalizing documentation for the server and client alignment with ADK examples.

[2025-05-15 23:02:00] - Recent Changes: Redesigned the agent widget UI to a standard chatbot interface.
    - HTML (`agent_widget.html`): Restructured `.text-chat-container` with a new `.chat-input-area` (input field and send button). Removed redundant elements from footer.
    - CSS (`agent_widget.css`):
        - Modified `.widget-body`, `.text-chat-container`, `.message-area`, `.chat-input` for new layout and scrolling.
        - Added new styles for `.chat-input-area`, `.send-btn`, individual messages (`.message`, `.user-message`, `.agent-message`), and scrollbar.
    - JavaScript (`agent_widget.js`):
        - Updated `addMessageToChat` to create new message HTML structure (div with paragraph and timestamp).
        - Added event listener for the new send button.
        - Included extensive console logging for debugging.
[2025-05-15 23:02:00] - Current Focus: Finalizing documentation of the agent widget UI redesign.

[2025-05-15 23:44:00] - Recent Changes: Implemented UI fixes for agent widget based on architect's plan.
    - HTML (`cymbal_home_garden_backend/templates/agent_widget.html`): Removed specified HTML comments.
    - CSS (`cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/agent_widget.css`):
        - Changed `padding` in `.widget-footer` from `10px 15px` to `5px 15px`.
        - Added `line-height: 1;` to `.footer-icon i`.
[2025-05-15 23:44:00] - Current Focus: Finalizing agent widget UI fixes.

[2025-05-16 13:52:25] - Recent Changes: Fixed `product_url` issue in `agents/customer-service/customer_service/tools/tools.py` (changed to `product_uri` in `get_product_recommendations` function, added logging). Acknowledged `image_url` verification steps.
[2025-05-16 13:52:25] - Current Focus: Finalizing documentation for the `product_url` fix.

[2025-05-16 15:04:00] - Recent Changes: Implemented product detail pages.
    - Added new Flask route `/products/<product_id>` in `app.py` to serve product detail pages.
    - Created `cymbal_home_garden_backend/templates/base.html` for common page structure.
    - Created `cymbal_home_garden_backend/templates/404.html` for user-friendly error page.
    - Created `cymbal_home_garden_backend/templates/product_detail.html` to display product information.
    - Added CSS to `cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/style.css` for product detail page styling.
    - Updated `get_product_recommendations` in `agents/customer-service/customer_service/tools/tools.py` to construct `product_url` as `/products/<product_id>`.
[2025-05-16 15:04:00] - Current Focus: Product detail pages and linking implemented.
