[2025-05-16 20:51:00] - Task Completed: Agent-initiated cart updates are visually reflected on the website.
    - Description: Implemented a 'refresh_cart' command flow allowing the agent to trigger a visual refresh of the shopping cart on the main website. This involved changes in agent tools, the ADK streaming server, the agent widget JavaScript, and the main page JavaScript.
    - Status: Functionality implemented as reported.
[2025-05-16 20:23:07] - Task Completed: Agent-controlled website night mode.
    - Description: The agent can now toggle night/day mode on the website. This involved backend agent logic, frontend theme switching (`style.css`, `script.js` with CSS variables and `localStorage`), and agent-to-frontend communication (`streaming_server.py`, `agent_widget.js`, `script.js`).
    - Status: Fully implemented and functional.
[2025-05-12 22:16:00] - Task Completed: Debugged and fixed Retail API integration issues.

[2025-05-12 22:41:00] - Task Update: Backend API for product availability (`/api/products/availability/...`) now correctly handles and reports non-existent product IDs with a 404 error.

[2025-05-12 22:50:57] - Task Update: Modified agent prompt (`agents/customer-service/customer_service/prompts.py`) to enforce proactive cart checking using `access_cart_information` tool. Documented in `decisionLog.md` and `activeContext.md`.

[2025-05-12 23:03:04] - Task Update: Implemented `search_products` tool and updated agent prompts to use it for general product searches. This addresses the issue of the agent misusing `get_product_recommendations` and hallucinating product IDs. Documented in `decisionLog.md` and `activeContext.md`.

[2025-05-12 23:11:29] - Task Update: Refined agent prompts in `agents/customer-service/customer_service/prompts.py` to improve interaction flow. Agent will now ask clarifying questions after product search and offer accessory recommendations after adding a plant to the cart. Documented in `decisionLog.md` and `activeContext.md`.

[2025-05-12 23:38:27] - Task Update: Further refined agent prompts in `prompts.py` for cart access (silent checks) and recommendation flow. Modified `get_product_recommendations` tool in `tools.py` to fetch specific product IDs based on primary product attributes. Documented in `decisionLog.md` and `activeContext.md`.

[2025-05-12 23:40:41] - Task Update: Agent prompts in `prompts.py` updated to include offering care instructions after adding a plant to cart and offering planting services post-purchase. Documented in `decisionLog.md` and `activeContext.md`.

[2025-05-13 00:13:52] - Task Update: User successfully started `adk web` from the correct directory (`agents/customer-service/`) with the `--session_db_url` argument. `DatabaseSessionService` initialized. Awaiting user test of voice/video. Documented in `decisionLog.md` and `activeContext.md`.

[2025-05-13 23:03:00] - Task Completed: Resolved issues with ADK agent voice and video features in the custom widget.
    - **Client-Side Refactoring:**
        - `cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/agent_widget.js` was rewritten to use WebSockets and Web Audio API (AudioWorklets) for voice communication, following ADK's "Custom Audio Streaming app" tutorial.
        - New helper JavaScript modules created: `pcm-player-processor.js`, `pcm-recorder-processor.js`, and `audio-modules.js` under `cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/js/`.
        - `cymbal_home_garden_backend/templates/agent_widget.html` updated to load `agent_widget.js` as `type="module"`.
    - **Server-Side Configuration & Dependencies:**
        - ADK agent model in `agents/customer-service/customer_service/config.py` changed to `gemini-2.0-flash-live-preview-04-09`.
        - Python `websockets` library downgraded from `15.0.1` to `13.0.0` to fix `TypeError: BaseEventLoop.create_connection() got an unexpected keyword argument 'extra_headers'` which occurred with Python 3.12.9 during video streaming attempts. Version `13.0.0` is compatible with `google-generativeai==1.14.0`.
    - **Outcome:** Voice and video features are now functional.
    - Documented in `decisionLog.md`, `activeContext.md`, `techContext.md`, and `systemPatterns.md`.

[2025-05-14 22:46:00] - Task Completed: Successfully integrated the customer service agent widget's core communication (HTTP session creation and WebSocket) into the Cymbal Home Garden e-commerce website via a Node.js proxy server.
    - **Problem Solved:** Resolved persistent `405 Method Not Allowed` errors during ADK session creation and subsequent WebSocket connection failures when embedding the widget from `localhost:5000` (Flask app) trying to communicate with ADK server on `localhost:8000`.
    - **Key Solutions:**
        - **HTTP Session Proxy:** Implemented a manual proxy in `proxy-server.js` for the `/apps/**` ADK session creation path. This was necessary because `http-proxy-middleware` was not correctly handling the `POST` request (with an empty body), leading to the `onProxyReq` event not firing and a 405 error likely originating from the proxy itself. The manual proxy ensures the request to the ADK server is formatted as expected (empty body, correct headers).
        - **WebSocket Proxy:** Configured `http-proxy-middleware` in `proxy-server.js` to correctly handle WebSocket upgrade requests for the `/run_live` path by explicitly attaching its `upgrade` handler to the main HTTP server instance.
        - **Client-Side Request:** Ensured `agent_widget.js` sends `body: undefined` for the session creation `fetch` POST, resulting in `Content-Length: 0`.
        - **CORS:** Updated `proxy-server.js` to handle CORS correctly for requests from both `http://localhost:5000` and `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
    - **Outcome:** The agent widget can now reliably create an ADK session and establish a WebSocket connection through the proxy server. This unblocks further development of chat, voice, and video features.
    - Documented in `decisionLog.md`, `activeContext.md`, `techContext.md`, and `systemPatterns.md`.

[2025-05-15 20:21:00] - Task Completed: Resolved `AttributeError: 'LiveServerContent' object has no attribute 'text'` in Cymbal Home Garden agent.
    - **Problem Solved:** The `agent_to_client_messaging` function in `agents/customer-service/streaming_server.py` was crashing when ADK `runner.run_live` yielded events (e.g., function calls, status updates) that did not have a direct `text` attribute on their `server_content` or `content` objects.
    - **Key Solutions:**
        - Modified `agents/customer-service/streaming_server.py`:
            - The `agent_to_client_messaging` function now inspects `agent_event.server_content.parts` if available.
            - It iterates through these `parts` to find `part.text` or `part.blob` (for audio).
            - It explicitly handles status events like `interaction_completed`, `turn_complete`, and `interrupted`.
            - Unhandled or empty events are logged and skipped.
            - Enhanced error handling within the function to prevent WebSocket crashes.
        - Modified `cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/agent_widget.js`:
            - The `websocket.onopen` handler now sends an initial greeting ("Hello, how can you assist me with gardening?") after the "client_ready" message to encourage a text-based response from the agent.
    - **Outcome:** The streaming server should now be more resilient to varied event types from the ADK live runner, preventing crashes and ensuring smoother communication with the client.
    - Documented in `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, and `decisionLog.md`.

[2025-05-15 22:03:00] - Task Update: Corrected client-side message handling in `cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/agent_widget.js`.
    - **Problem Solved:** The `websocket.onmessage` handler was not correctly processing status-only messages (e.g., `{"status":"turn_complete"}`) from the server because it expected a `mime_type` field, leading to agent text responses not being displayed.
    - **Key Solution:**
        - Modified `websocket.onmessage` in `agent_widget.js` to first check for `parsedData.status`. If a status is present, it's handled (logged, `currentAgentMessageElement` reset), and the function returns.
        - If no `parsedData.status` is found, the logic proceeds to check for `parsedData.mime_type` to handle text or audio content.
    - **Outcome:** The agent widget should now correctly process both status updates and content messages from the streaming server, allowing agent text responses to be displayed.
    - Documented in `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, and `decisionLog.md`.

[2025-05-15 22:08:00] - Task Update: Aligned ADK streaming event handling in `streaming_server.py` and `agent_widget.js` with the "Custom Audio Streaming app.md" example.
    - **Problem Solved:** Agent text responses were not appearing in the client widget. Investigation of memory bank documents (specifically "Custom Audio Streaming app.md") revealed discrepancies in how status messages (e.g., `turn_complete`) were formatted by the server and handled by the client, and a crucial control flow issue (missing `continue` after sending status) in the server's event loop.
    - **Key Solutions:**
        - **`agents/customer-service/streaming_server.py` (`agent_to_client_messaging` function):**
            - Modified to send status events (turn_complete, interrupted, interaction_completed) as a JSON object with boolean flags (e.g., `{"turn_complete": true, "interrupted": false, ...}`).
            - Crucially, added a `continue` statement after sending a status message to ensure the server fetches the next event from the ADK runner, rather than trying to process content from the same event that signaled the status.
        - **`cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/agent_widget.js` (`websocket.onmessage` function):**
            - Updated to expect and check for boolean flags (`parsedData.turn_complete`, `parsedData.interrupted`, `parsedData.interaction_completed`) directly on the parsed JSON object.
            - If any of these status flags are true, the client handles it (logs, resets current message element) and returns, not expecting further content in that specific message.
    - **Outcome:** The server and client should now have a consistent understanding of status and content message formats, and the server's event loop should correctly process events, allowing agent text responses to be properly relayed and displayed.
    - Documented in `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, and `decisionLog.md`.

[2025-05-15 23:02:00] - Task Completed: Redesigned Agent Widget UI to Standard Chatbot.
