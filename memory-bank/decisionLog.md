[2025-05-12 22:16:00] - Retail API Integration Debugging:
    - Issue: Retail API calls were failing with 404 and 500 errors in tests.
    - Root Causes:
        1. Incorrect `RETAIL_API_LOCATION` (was `us-central1`, should be `global`).
        2. Incorrect parsing of product ID and name from the Retail API response. The API returns product ID in `result.id` and the fully qualified product name in `result.product.name`. The actual product title/display name was not directly available in the `product` object within `result` in the way initially assumed.
    - Fixes:
        1. Changed `RETAIL_API_LOCATION` to `"global"` in `app.py`.
        2. Modified `app.py` to use `result.id` as `product_id`.
        3. Modified `app.py` to look up the product display name from `SAMPLE_PRODUCTS` using the `product_id` obtained from `result.id`, as the direct `product.title` was not consistently populated or available as expected from the API response structure observed in logs.
        4. Updated tests in `test_api.py` to align with the corrected response structure being built in `app.py`.
    - Implications: The Retail API integration is now functioning correctly, and tests are passing. This ensures that product search via Vertex AI Search for commerce is working as intended.
[2025-05-12 22:41:00] - `check_product_availability` Tool Debugging:
    - Issue: Agent tool calls to `/api/products/availability/...` were resulting in 404 errors for product IDs like `herb-soil-123` and `herb-fert-456`.
    - Root Cause: The specified product IDs did not exist in the `SAMPLE_PRODUCTS` list in `sample_data_importer.py` and thus were not in the `ecommerce.db`. The backend endpoint was not explicitly returning a 404 in this scenario initially.
    - Fix:
        1. Verified product IDs were missing from `sample_data_importer.py`.
        2. Updated the `check_product_availability_endpoint` in `app.py` to explicitly return a 404 status and a JSON error message `{"error": "Product not found for availability check"}` when a product ID is not found in the database.
    - Implications: The backend API now correctly signals when a product is not found for an availability check. The agent still attempts to use non-existent IDs, which is an agent-side data/logic issue to be potentially addressed separately.
[2025-05-12 22:50:32] - Agent Cart Access Debugging:
    - Issue: Customer service agent was not proactively using the `access_cart_information` tool before making recommendations, instead asking the user about their cart.
    - Root Cause: LLM interpretation/prioritization issue; the existing prompt instruction was not consistently enforced.
    - Fix: Added a more explicit and emphasized instruction in `agents/customer-service/customer_service/prompts.py` under the "Product Identification and Recommendation" section to mandate using the `access_cart_information` tool before recommending or asking about the cart.
    - Implications: The agent should now be more likely to check the cart contents automatically, improving the user experience and adhering to its intended logic.
[2025-05-12 23:02:42] - Agent Product Search and Recommendation Debugging:
    - Issue: Agent was using `get_product_recommendations` (intended for accessories based on `plant_type`) for general product name searches (e.g., "rosemary"), leading to no results and subsequent hallucination of product IDs.
    - Root Cause: Lack of a dedicated product search tool and misapplication of the recommendation tool.
    - Fixes:
        1. Created a new `search_products` tool in `agents/customer-service/customer_service/tools/tools.py` that calls the backend `/api/retail/search-products` endpoint (which uses Vertex AI Search).
        2. Registered the `search_products` tool in `agents/customer-service/customer_service/agent.py`.
        3. Updated `agents/customer-service/customer_service/prompts.py` to instruct the agent to use `search_products` for general queries and clarified that `get_product_recommendations` is for finding accessories for an already known plant type.
    - Implications: The agent should now use the correct tool for product searches, leveraging the Vertex AI Search backend, and use the recommendation tool more appropriately. This should lead to more accurate product finding and prevent hallucination of product IDs.
[2025-05-12 23:11:09] - Agent Interaction Flow Refinement:
    - Issue 1: Agent was not asking clarifying questions (e.g., quantity) after finding a product via search and before offering to add it to the cart.
    - Issue 2: Agent was not offering accessory recommendations after a plant product was added to the cart.
    - Root Cause: Lack of explicit instructions in the agent's prompt for these specific interaction flows.
    - Fix: Modified `agents/customer-service/customer_service/prompts.py` to:
        1. Instruct the agent to present product details and ask clarifying questions (quantity, variety confirmation) after a successful `search_products` call and before offering to add to cart.
        2. Instruct the agent to use the `get_product_recommendations` tool with the `plant_type` of an added plant product to suggest accessories, after the plant is confirmed or added to the cart.
    - Implications: The agent should now have a more natural and helpful conversation flow, clarifying user needs before carting items and proactively offering relevant accessory recommendations.
[2025-05-12 23:38:01] - Agent Recommendation and Cart Interaction Refinement:
    - Issue 1 (Cart Interaction): Agent was explicitly asking if it should check the cart, instead of doing it silently.
    - Issue 2 (Recommendations): Agent was not using the `recommended_soil_ids` (and similar) attributes from a found product to fetch and recommend specific accessory products. It was still trying to use `plant_type` with `get_product_recommendations` which was not effective.
    - Root Cause: Prompting logic needed further refinement for both cart access and the new recommendation flow.
    - Fixes:
        1. Modified `agents/customer-service/customer_service/prompts.py` to instruct the agent to use `access_cart_information` silently before cart operations and not to ask the user explicitly if it should check.
        2. Modified `get_product_recommendations` tool in `agents/customer-service/customer_service/tools/tools.py` to accept a list of product IDs and fetch their full details from the `/api/products/<product_id>` backend endpoint.
        3. Updated `agents/customer-service/customer_service/prompts.py` to instruct the agent, after finding a primary product, to extract recommended product IDs (e.g., `recommended_soil_ids`) from its attributes and pass these IDs to the revamped `get_product_recommendations` tool to fetch and present detailed accessory suggestions.
    - Implications: Agent should now handle cart checks more smoothly and provide more targeted and accurate product recommendations based on the attributes of the primary product selected by the user.
[2025-05-12 23:40:17] - Agent Post-Add/Post-Purchase Flow Refinement:
    - Issue 1: Agent was not offering care instructions after a plant was added to the cart.
    - Issue 2: Agent was not cued to offer planting services post-purchase.
    - Root Cause: Lack of explicit instructions in the agent's prompt for these specific post-action flows.
    - Fix: Modified `agents/customer-service/customer_service/prompts.py` to:
        1. Instruct the agent, after successfully adding a plant to the cart, to offer to send care instructions for that plant using the `send_care_instructions` tool.
        2. Instruct the agent, after an order is successfully placed/confirmed, to offer `schedule_planting_service` if relevant plant items were purchased.
    - Implications: The agent should now provide more comprehensive post-item-addition and post-purchase support by offering relevant services and information.
[2025-05-12 23:57:04] - ADK Web Voice/Video Session Debugging:
    - Issue: "Session not found" error when enabling voice or video in `adk web` for the customer service agent, despite token streaming being enabled. Followed by `ImportError` for `FileSystemSessionService`.
    - Root Cause: The default `InMemorySessionService` is insufficient for persistent voice/video streams. `FileSystemSessionService` was not found in the `google.adk.sessions` module.
    - Fix: Reverted changes in `agents/customer-service/customer_service/agent.py` that attempted to instantiate `DatabaseSessionService` directly. Session service is configured via `--session_db_url` CLI argument.
    - Issue: `sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file` when `adk web --session_db_url sqlite:///customer_service/adk_sessions.db` is run from the workspace root (`adk-samples/`).
    - Root Cause: The relative `db_url` path `sqlite:///customer_service/adk_sessions.db` is incorrect when the Current Working Directory (CWD) is `adk-samples/`.
    - Resolution: User successfully ran `adk web --session_db_url sqlite:///customer_service/adk_sessions.db` from the `agents/customer-service/` directory. Server started and `DatabaseSessionService` initialized.
    - Implications: Persistent session storage via `DatabaseSessionService` is now active. The original "Session not found" error for voice/video should be resolved.
[2025-05-15 20:21:00] - ADK LiveServerContent AttributeError Handling:
    - Issue: `AttributeError: 'LiveServerContent' object has no attribute 'text'` in `agent_to_client_messaging` function within `agents/customer-service/streaming_server.py`. This occurred when the ADK's `runner.run_live` yielded events from the Gemini Live API (e.g., `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`) that were not simple text responses, such as function calls, status updates (`turn_complete`, `interaction_completed`), or other non-text `Part` objects within `LiveServerContent`.
    - Root Cause: The `agent_to_client_messaging` function previously assumed that `agent_event.server_content` (or `agent_event.content`) would always have a directly accessible `.text` attribute. However, `LiveServerContent` (from `google.genai.live`) can contain various event types, and text is typically found within `content.parts[i].text`.
    - Fixes:
        1.  **`agents/customer-service/streaming_server.py` (`agent_to_client_messaging` function):**
            *   Modified to first check for and handle status events (`interaction_completed`, `turn_complete`, `interrupted`).
            *   If it's a content event (`agent_event.server_content` exists), it now checks if `content.parts` exists.
            *   It iterates through `content.parts`:
                *   If a `part` has a `text` attribute, that text is sent to the client.
                *   If a `part` has a `blob` attribute (and it's audio), it's base64 encoded and sent.
                *   `function_call` parts are logged but currently not processed further for client transmission.
            *   Unhandled events or events where no suitable data is found for the client are logged.
            *   Enhanced `try/except` blocks for `WebSocketDisconnect`, `asyncio.CancelledError`, and generic `Exception` to improve robustness and logging.
        2.  **`cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/agent_widget.js` (`websocket.onopen` handler):**
            *   Modified to send two initial messages upon WebSocket connection:
                1.  `{ mime_type: "text/plain", data: "client_ready" }`
                2.  `{ mime_type: "text/plain", data: "Hello, how can you assist me with gardening?" }`
            *   This second message aims to prompt an initial text response from the agent, as "client_ready" alone might not elicit one, potentially contributing to events without text.
    - Implications: The streaming server should now be more resilient to the variety of events produced by the ADK's live runner and the Gemini Live API. This should prevent crashes due to the `AttributeError` and ensure that text and audio content are correctly extracted and forwarded to the client. The client-side change helps in initiating a more typical conversational flow. This aligns with ADK 0.5.0 and google-genai 1.14.0 documentation regarding `LiveServerContent` and `Content`/`Part` structures.
[2025-05-15 22:03:00] - Client-Side WebSocket Message Handling for Status Updates:
    - Issue: Agent text responses were not appearing in the `agent_widget.js` UI. Client-side logs showed "Received unhandled mime_type: undefined" for messages like `{"status":"turn_complete"}`.
    - Root Cause: The `websocket.onmessage` handler in `cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/agent_widget.js` was checking for `parsedData.mime_type` before checking if the message was a status update. Status messages (e.g., `{"status":"interrupted"}`, `{"status":"turn_complete"}`) sent by the server do not contain a `mime_type`.
    - Fix:
        1.  **`cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/agent_widget.js` (`websocket.onmessage` function):**
            *   Modified the logic to first parse the incoming JSON.
            *   Then, it explicitly checks if `parsedData.status` exists.
            *   If `parsedData.status` is present (e.g., "turn_complete", "interrupted", "interaction_completed"), the status is logged, `currentAgentMessageElement` is reset (as these messages signify the end of a stream or an interruption), and the handler returns, as no further displayable content is expected.
            *   If `parsedData.status` is *not* present, the handler then proceeds to check `parsedData.mime_type` to process "text/plain" or "audio/pcm" content as before.
    - Implications: The client-side widget should now correctly interpret status-only messages from the server, allowing it to properly process subsequent content messages (like agent text responses) and display them in the chat UI. This resolves the issue where agent text was generated but not seen by the user.
[2025-05-15 22:08:00] - ADK Streaming Event Handling Alignment with Documentation:
    - Issue: Agent text responses were not appearing in the client widget, despite previous fixes. Client logs indicated issues with handling status messages, and server logs (from user) showed agent was generating text.
    - Root Cause Analysis: Review of `memory-bank/Custom Audio Streaming app.md` revealed a mismatch between the project's server-client message format/handling for status events (like `turn_complete`) and the ADK example.
        - The example server sends status as boolean flags (e.g., `{"turn_complete": true, "interrupted": false}`) and uses `continue` in its event loop after sending such a status.
        - The project's server was sending `{"status": "turn_complete"}` and lacked the crucial `continue`, potentially mishandling events that had both status flags and content.
        - The project's client was adapted to the server's incorrect format, but this didn't resolve the underlying issue of content not being sent/processed correctly due to the server's event loop logic.
    - Fixes:
        1.  **`agents/customer-service/streaming_server.py` (`agent_to_client_messaging` function):**
            *   Modified to align with the "Custom Audio Streaming app.md" example.
            *   Status events (`turn_complete`, `interrupted`, `interaction_completed`) are now sent as a JSON object with boolean flags: `{"turn_complete": <bool>, "interrupted": <bool>, "interaction_completed": <bool>}`.
            *   A `continue` statement was added after sending a status message. This ensures that if an event signals completion/interruption, the server moves to the next event from the ADK runner, rather than attempting to find content in the same event object that signaled the status. This was a key missing piece.
            *   Content (text/audio) is processed from `agent_event.server_content.parts` if the event is not a status event handled by the `continue`.
        2.  **`cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/agent_widget.js` (`websocket.onmessage` function):**
            *   Updated to expect and check for the new boolean status flags (`parsedData.turn_complete`, `parsedData.interrupted`, `parsedData.interaction_completed`) directly on the parsed JSON object.
            *   If any of these flags are true, the client logs the status, resets `currentAgentMessageElement`, and returns, as no further displayable content is expected in that message.
            *   If not a status message, it proceeds to check `mime_type` for text or audio.
    - Implications: This comprehensive alignment of both server-side event loop logic and message formatting, along with corresponding client-side handling, based on the ADK example documentation, should robustly fix the issue of agent text responses not being displayed. The server will now correctly distinguish between status-only events and content-bearing events, and the client will interpret them correctly.
[2025-05-15 23:02:00] - Agent Widget UI Redesign to Chatbot Interface:
    - Issue: The existing agent widget UI had text overflow and scrolling problems, and did not resemble a standard chatbot.
    - Root Cause: HTML structure and CSS were not optimized for a scrolling chat interface with a fixed input area.
    - Fixes:
        1.  **HTML (`cymbal_home_garden_backend/templates/agent_widget.html`):**
            *   Restructured the `.text-chat-container` to include a dedicated `.message-area` for scrollable messages and a new `.chat-input-area` div.
            *   The `.chat-input-area` now contains the `<input type="text" class="chat-input">` and a new `<button class="send-btn">`.
            *   Removed the `text-input-placeholder` and `chat-icon` from the `.widget-footer` as the input is now part of the main body.
        2.  **CSS (`cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/agent_widget.css`):**
            *   Modified `.agent-widget` and `.widget-body` to use `display: flex; flex-direction: column;` to ensure proper stacking and that `.widget-body` fills available space.
            *   Set `.widget-body` to `overflow: hidden;`
            *   Styled `.text-chat-container` to `display: flex; flex-direction: column; height: 100%; overflow: hidden; box-sizing: border-box;`.
            *   Modified `.message-area` to `flex-grow: 1; overflow-y: auto; display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 10px;` for scrolling and message stacking.
            *   Added scrollbar styling for `.message-area`.
            *   Styled the new `.chat-input-area` to be a flex container, fixed at the bottom of `.text-chat-container`.
            *   Restyled `.chat-input` for a pill shape and to `flex-grow: 1;`.
            *   Added styles for the new `.send-btn` (circular, themed).
            *   Added new CSS classes and styles for individual messages:
                *   `.message` (common styling, `word-wrap: break-word; display: flex; flex-direction: column;`).
                *   `.message p` (for text content).
                *   `.message .timestamp` (for timestamps, aligned to the right of the bubble).
                *   `.user-message` (right-aligned, different background).
                *   `.agent-message` (left-aligned, different background).
        3.  **JavaScript (`cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/agent_widget.js`):**
            *   Modified the `addMessageToChat` function to create the new HTML structure for messages: a `div.message` containing a `p` for the text and a `span.timestamp`.
            *   Added an event listener for the new `.send-btn` to trigger sending the message from `chatInput`.
            *   Ensured `scrollToBottom()` is called after adding messages.
            *   Added extensive `console.log` statements for debugging purposes throughout the modified and new JavaScript sections.
    - Implications: The agent widget should now look and function more like a standard chatbot, with improved text display, scrolling capabilities, and a dedicated input area with a send button. This addresses the previous UI/UX issues.
[2025-05-15 23:44:00] - Agent Widget UI Fixes (Comment Removal & Footer Icon):
    - Decision: Implement UI fixes as per architect's plan to remove specific HTML comments and resolve footer icon cut-off.
    - Rationale: Improve code clarity by removing unnecessary comments and enhance UI by fixing visual bug with footer icons.
    - Implementation Details:
        - In `cymbal_home_garden_backend/templates/agent_widget.html`:
            - Removed HTML comment `{/* Initially hidden */}` from line 11.
            - Removed HTML comment `{/* Visible in text mode */}` from line 30.
        - In `cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/agent_widget.css`:
            - Modified `.widget-footer` (around line 218): Changed `padding: 10px 15px;` to `padding: 5px 15px;`.
            - Added CSS rule `.footer-icon i { line-height: 1; }`.
[2025-05-16 13:52:36] - Product Recommendation Card Fix (`product_url`):
    - Issue: Product recommendation cards were not interactive due to `product_url: None`. The `get_product_recommendations` tool was attempting to fetch `product_data.get("product_url")`.
    - Root Cause: The API response field for the product link was `product_uri`, not `product_url`.
    - Fix:
        1. Modified `agents/customer-service/customer_service/tools/tools.py` (around line 266) in the `get_product_recommendations` function.
        2. Changed `product_data.get("product_url")` to `product_data.get("product_uri")`.
        3. Added a log statement: `logger.info(f"Product ID {product_id} fetched product_uri: {formatted_product.get('product_url')}")` to confirm the value being fetched (note: the key in `formatted_product` remains `product_url` for consistency with what the frontend might expect, but it's now populated from `product_uri`).
    - Implications: Product recommendation cards should now have the correct URL, making them interactive.
    - Image URL (404s): Acknowledged as a data/path verification issue. No code changes made in `tools.py` for this, as the tool correctly passes through the `image_url` it receives. Fix relies on correct data in `ecommerce.db` and image files in `cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/images/`.

[2025-05-16 15:04:00] - Implemented Product Detail Pages and Linking:
    - Decision: Create product detail pages and update links as per the approved plan.
    - Rationale: Resolve 404 errors from product recommendation cards and provide users with actual product pages.
    - Implementation Details:
        - Added a new Flask route `@app.route('/products/<string:product_id>')` in `app.py` to fetch product data from `ecommerce.db` and render `product_detail.html`.
        - Created `cymbal_home_garden_backend/templates/base.html` to provide a consistent layout (header, footer, common assets) for all frontend pages.
        - Created `cymbal_home_garden_backend/templates/404.html` for a user-friendly "Page Not Found" experience, extending `base.html`.
        - Created the main `cymbal_home_garden_backend/templates/product_detail.html` template, extending `base.html`. This template displays product name, image, price, description, attributes, and an "Add to Cart" button with JavaScript functionality.
        - Added CSS rules to `cymbal_home_garden_backend/static/style.css` for styling the product detail page elements, including layout, typography, and responsiveness.
        - Modified the `get_product_recommendations` tool in `agents/customer-service/customer_service/tools/tools.py` to construct `product_url` values in the format `/products/<product_id>`, ensuring recommendation cards link to the new detail pages.
        - Corrected JavaScript in `product_detail.html` to properly handle Jinja-templated product data by reading it from a `data-product` HTML attribute.
    - Implications: Product recommendation cards in the agent widget should now link to functional product detail pages. Users can view detailed information about products.
