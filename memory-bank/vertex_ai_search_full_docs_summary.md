## 1. Overview and Implementation Steps
(Source: `https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/overview`, Last Updated: 2025-04-21 UTC)

Vertex AI Search for commerce helps implement personalized search and recommendations using machine learning models. The same data (catalog and user events) is used for both search and recommendations.

**Key Implementation Phases:**

1.  **Project Setup:**
    *   Set up a Google Cloud project.
    *   Create authentication credentials (API key, OAuth token).

2.  **Data Ingestion:**
    *   **Product Catalog:**
        *   Can be imported via Google Merchant Center (for users with existing MC integration, though it has limitations like no facet support and no collections product type).
        *   Can be imported directly using `Products.create` (for individual items) or `Products.import` (for bulk, recommended for large catalogs). This offers more configurability.
    *   **User Events:**
        *   Track user actions (clicks, add-to-cart, purchases).
        *   Can be recorded using Google Tag Manager.
        *   Can be recorded by writing a custom tracking pixel and sending events in real-time.
        *   Events should be rejoined if uploaded before catalog import is complete.
    *   **Historical User Events:**
        *   Import past user events (from Google Analytics, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, or inline via `userEvents.import`) to accelerate model training.
        *   Sufficient training data is crucial for model accuracy.

3.  **Configuration and Modeling:**
    *   **Set up Monitoring and Alerts:** For data ingestion and service health.
    *   **Create Serving Configs, Models, and Controls:**
        *   A serving config associates a model and optional controls.
        *   For recommendations, choose a model type based on objectives (e.g., "Others you may like," "Frequently bought together") and tune options.
        *   For search, a default model is automatically created.
    *   **Model Training and Tuning:**
        *   Automatic for search once data thresholds are met.
        *   For recommendations, creating a model initiates training (2-5 days, longer for large datasets).

4.  **Testing and Evaluation:**
    *   **Preview and Test Serving Configs:** Ensure results are as expected. Use the "Evaluations" page in the console.
    *   **A/B Testing (Optional):** Compare performance with and without Vertex AI Search for commerce.
    *   **Evaluate Metrics:** Use the "Analytics" page to assess business impact.

**General Notes:**
*   Average integration time is in weeks, depending on data quality and quantity.
*   User event data requirements vary by model type and optimization objective.
    *   Terms of Service: Usage is under Google Cloud's T&Cs. Some data may be used for quality assurance with third-party vendors.

## 2. Product Catalog Import and Schema Guidelines
(Source: `https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/upload-catalog`, Last Updated: 2025-05-05 UTC, Verified: 2025-05-10)

This section summarizes key guidelines for formatting product data for ingestion into Google Cloud Vertex AI Search for commerce.

### 2.1. Data Format for Import (via Cloud Storage)
*   **JSONL (JSON Lines):** Each product item must be a complete JSON object on a new line in the `.jsonl` file.

### 2.2. Minimum Required Product Fields
The following fields are mandatory for each product item:
*   `id`: (String) A unique identifier for the product.
*   `categories`: (String) The product category hierarchy. Example: `"Apparel & Accessories > Shoes"` or `"Home & Garden > Plants > Perennials"`.
*   `title`: (String) The name of the product.

### 2.3. Custom Attributes (`Product.attributes`)
Custom attributes allow for rich, product-specific data. They are defined within the `attributes` field, which is a map (object).
*   **Structure:** Each key in the `attributes` map is the custom attribute's name (e.g., `botanical_name`, `light_requirement`, `is_pet_friendly`).
*   **Value Format:** The value for each custom attribute *must* be an object containing either:
    *   `"text"`: An array of strings. Example: `{"vendor": {"text": ["vendor123", "vendor456"]}}`
    *   `"numbers"`: An array of numbers. Example: `{"npk_ratio": {"numbers": [10, 10, 10]}}`
*   **Boolean Custom Attributes:** There is no direct boolean type for custom attributes. They **must** be represented using the `"text"` format.
    *   Example for `true`: `{"is_pet_friendly": {"text": ["true"]}}`
    *   Example for `false`: `{"is_drought_tolerant": {"text": ["false"]}}`
    *   This is a critical formatting requirement.

### 2.4. Other Important Standard Fields (and their format from examples)
*   `name`: (String) The fully qualified product name. Example: `"projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/0/products/PRODUCT_ID"` (Often auto-generated or can be set).
*   `description`: (String) A detailed description of the product.
*   `language_code`: (String) The language of the product information (e.g., `"en"`).
*   `tags`: (Array of Strings) Tags associated with the product (e.g., `["black-friday", "sale"]`).
*   `priceInfo`: (Object) Contains pricing details:
    *   `currencyCode`: (String) The currency code (e.g., `"USD"`).
    *   `price`: (Number) The current selling price.
    *   `originalPrice`: (Number, Optional) The original price before discounts.
    *   `cost`: (Number, Optional) The cost of the product.
*   `availableTime`: (String) The time the product becomes available, in ISO 8601 format. Example: `"2020-01-01T03:33:33.000001Z"`.
*   `expireTime`: (String) The time the product expires, in ISO 8601 format. Used for historical products. Example: `"2021-10-02T15:01:23Z"`.
*   `availableQuantity`: (String, as per documentation example) The quantity available. Example: `"1"`. While representing a number, the example uses a string.
*   `uri`: (String) The canonical URI of the product page on your website.
*   `images`: (Array of Objects) Each object represents an image and contains:
    *   `uri`: (String) Publicly accessible URI of the image.
    *   `height`: (Number) Height of the image in pixels.
    *   `width`: (Number) Width of the image in pixels.

### 2.5. General Best Practices for Catalog Import
*   Keep catalog data up to date, ideally with daily imports.
*   Ensure high-quality data: avoid placeholder values and include as much optional information as possible.
*   Use a single currency per catalog if using Google Cloud console for revenue metrics.
*   Monitor import health and error reports.
*   For bulk import from Cloud Storage, each file must be 2 GB or smaller, up to 100 files per import request.
*   For inline import, max 5,000 items at a time (though the documentation also says "No more than 100 catalog items can be imported at a time" under "Inline import" limitations table - this might be a typo or context dependent, prefer the 5000 limit if using `ProductInlineSource` with multiple products).
*   Product levels (`primary` vs `variant`) are important and should be set carefully before initial import.
    *   Historical catalog data can be imported by setting the `expireTime` to a past timestamp and `availability` to `OUT_OF_STOCK`.

## 3. Record Real-Time User Events
(Source: `https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/record-events`, Last Updated: 2025-04-24 UTC)

Real-time user events are crucial for generating personalized recommendations and search results. Recording many valid event types increases result quality.

### 3.1. Ways to Stream User Events
*   **JavaScript Pixel:** Embed a JS pixel on web pages.
*   **Google Analytics 4 (GA4) with Tag Manager:** Recommended method.
*   **Direct API Call (`userEvents.write`):** Send events from a backend server.
*   **Google Tag Manager (GTM):** Can be used standalone or with GA4.
*   **Server-Side Tagging:** Deploy a server-side GTM container.

### 3.2. Before You Begin
*   Google Cloud project set up with authentication.
*   Valid API key (for JS Pixel/GTM) or a service account with "Retail Editor" role (for direct API calls).
*   **Required Components:**
    *   **Attribution Token:** Captures first-time user interactions based on prior recommendations/search. See [Attribution Tokens](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/attribution-tokens).
    *   **Visitor IDs:** Required for all events. See [About user information](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/user-events#user-information).

### 3.3. Best Practices for Recording User Events
*   **Rejoin Events:** If events are recorded before catalog import completes, rejoin them using the API.
*   **Keep Catalog Up-to-Date:** Events for products not in the catalog are "unjoined" and not used for training.
*   **Provide Comprehensive Information:** Include as much detail as possible for each event type. Refer to [About user events](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/user-events) for schemas.
*   **Set Up Monitoring Alerts:** For event recording outages.
*   **Bulk Import Limits:** For user events, each file â‰¤ 2 GB, max 100 files per request. Import one day at a time.
*   **Accurate Timestamps:** Use `eventTime` in RFC 3339 format. Avoid identical timestamps for sequential events.
*   **Continuous Data:** Avoid gaps in user event data.
*   **Anonymize PII:** Use secure unique identifiers; redact PII like email/addresses.

### 3.4. Recording Methods Details

#### 3.4.1. JavaScript Pixel
*   Embed a script that pushes event data to `_gre` array.
*   Example provided for `detail-page-view`.
    ```javascript
    // Example structure
    var user_event = {
      "eventType" : "detail-page-view",
      "visitorId": "visitor-id", // Can be GA client ID
      "userInfo": { "userId": "user-id" },
      "attributionToken": "attribution-token",
      "productDetails": [ { "product": {"id": "123"} } ]
    };
    var _gre = _gre || [];
    _gre.push(['apiKey', 'your-api-key']);
    _gre.push(['logEvent', user_event]);
    _gre.push(['projectId', 'your-project-id']);
    // ... other config ...
    // Self-invoking function to load v2_event.js
    ```

#### 3.4.2. `userEvents.write` Method (Direct API)
*   Send a `POST` request to `https://retail.googleapis.com/v2/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/userEvents:write`.
*   Request body is the JSON `UserEvent` object.
*   Example `curl` command:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
         --data '{
             "eventType": "detail-page-view",
             "visitorId": "visitor0",
             "eventTime": "2020-01-01T03:33:33.000001Z",
             // ... other fields like productDetails, userInfo, attributes ...
        }' \
    "https://retail.googleapis.com/v2/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/userEvents:write"
    ```
*   Java client library example also available in docs.

#### 3.4.3. Google Analytics 4 (GA4)
*   Import GA4 user event data.
*   Ensure GA4 event reporting includes currency codes for purchase events and search queries for search events.
*   `search` events are constructed by combining `view_item_list` and `search_term` parameters from GA4.
*   Use `userEvents.collect` method with `prebuilt_rule=ga4_bq` and URL-encoded raw JSON data for the event.
    ```bash
    # Example GA4_EVENT JSON structure
    GA4_EVENT='{
         "event_timestamp": 1622994083878241,
         "event_name": "add_to_cart",
         "user_pseudo_id": "352499268.1622993559", // Maps to visitorId
         "items": [ { "item_id": "11", "price": 29.99, "quantity": 3 } ],
         "event_params": [ { "key": "currency", "value": { "string_value": "CAD" } } ],
         "user_id": "Alice"
    }'
    # API Call
    curl -G --data-urlencode "raw_json=${GA4_EVENT}" \
    "https://retail.googleapis.com/v2/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/userEvents:collect?key=API_KEY&prebuilt_rule=ga4_bq"
    ```

#### 3.4.4. Google Tag Manager (GTM)
*   Comprehensive setup involving:
    *   **Visitor ID Variable:** Create a GTM variable (e.g., from 1st party cookie `_ga` or custom JS) for `visitorId`.
    *   **Cloud Retail Tag:** Configure a "Cloud Retail" tag type in GTM.
        *   Provide API Key and Project Number.
        *   Select User Event Data Source (e.g., "Data Layer", "Variable, Cloud Retail", "Variable, Ecommerce").
        *   Overwrite `visitorId` field with the created variable.
    *   **Search Query Variable (if using search):** Create a GTM variable (URL, DOM element, or Custom JS) to capture search queries and attach it to the Cloud Retail tag.
    *   **Event Triggers:** Create triggers for all relevant user events (e.g., page views, add-to-cart clicks) and associate them with the Cloud Retail tag. Can reuse existing GA Ecommerce triggers.
    *   **Data Layer (`cloud_retail`):** If using "Variable, Cloud Retail" or "Data Layer" source, populate the `dataLayer` with a `cloud_retail` object matching the UserEvent schema.
        ```javascript
        // Example dataLayer push
        dataLayer.push({
          'cloud_retail': {
            'eventType': 'home-page-view',
            'visitorId': 'visitor_a', // Often overridden by GTM variable
            'userInfo': { 'userId': '789' },
            // ... other event details ...
          }
        });
        ```
*   **Preview and Debug:** Use GTM's preview mode and browser DevTools (Network tab, look for `userEvent:collect`) to test and debug tag firing and data.

#### 3.4.5. Server-Side Tagging
*   Deploy a server-side GTM container.
*   Cloud Retail server-side tag accepts similar parameters to the web tag.
*   Data source is a data stream from the Google tag in GA4 schema.

### 3.5. Monitoring and Viewing Events
*   Monitor event recording error rates via Cloud Monitoring alerts.
    *   View event integration metrics on the "Events" tab of the Search for commerce console "Data" page.

## 5. Create Recommendation Models
(Source: `https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/create-models`, Last Updated: 2025-04-17 UTC)

This section details the process of creating, training, and managing recommendation models.

### 5.1. Introduction
*   New recommendation models are needed when you want to use a new recommendation type.
*   Sufficient user event data is required for training.
*   Serving configs are created for models to request predictions.
*   Up to 20 models per project, 10 active. Max 5 model operations (create, delete, pause, resume) per minute.

### 5.2. Before Creating a Model
*   Review [model types](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/models#model-types) (e.g., "Recommended for You", "Others You May Like", "Frequently Bought Together", "Page-Level Optimization", "Similar Items", "Buy it Again") and [business objectives](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/models#opt-obj) (e.g., Click-through rate (CTR), Conversion rate (CVR), Revenue per session).
*   Decide model tuning frequency (every three months or manual).
*   Ensure data requirements are met (varies by model type, see detailed table in docs).
*   For Page-Level Optimization models:
    *   Requires existing trained recommendation serving configs.
    *   Requires event recording for `detail-page-view` and the page type being optimized (e.g., `home-page-view`). `purchase` and `add-to-cart` also recommended. CVR objective requires `add-to-cart`.
    *   Continue querying the model post-creation for impressions to improve it.

### 5.3. Creating a Recommendation Model
Can be done via Google Cloud Console or `models.Create` API method.

**API `Models.create` Request Body Example:**
```json
{
  "name": "FULL_MODEL_NAME", // e.g., projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/models/my-fbt-model
  "displayName": "DISPLAY_NAME",
  "trainingState": "TRAINING_STATE", // e.g., "TRAINING", "PAUSED"
  "type": "MODEL_TYPE", // e.g., "frequently-bought-together", "others-you-may-like"
  "optimizationObjective": "OPTIMIZATION_OBJECTIVE", // e.g., "CTR", "CVR"
  "periodicTuningState": "TUNING_STATE", // e.g., "PERIODIC_TUNING_ENABLED", "PERIODIC_TUNING_DISABLED"
  "filteringOption": "FILTERING_STATE", // e.g., "RECOMMENDATIONS_FILTERING_ENABLED", "RECOMMENDATIONS_FILTERING_DISABLED" (Public Preview)
  "modelTypeConfig": { // Specific to model type, e.g., for FBT
    "contextProductsType": "CONTEXT_PRODUCTS_TYPE" // "SINGLE_CONTEXT_PRODUCT" or "MULTIPLE_CONTEXT_PRODUCTS"
  }
}
```
*   **Path for API call:** `https://retail.googleapis.com/v2beta/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/models` (Note: `v2beta` might be used for newer features like `modelTypeConfig`). The main docs often refer to `v2`.

**Console Steps:**
1.  Go to Models page.
2.  Click "Create model".
3.  Enter name, choose recommendation type.
4.  For Page-Level Optimization: define page type, restriction for similar serving configs, panels (ID, selectable serving configs, default serving config).
5.  Choose business objective.
6.  For FBT: choose context products type.
7.  Review data requirements.
8.  Choose tuning frequency.
9.  Choose whether to auto-generate tags for filtering (Public Preview, increases training time/cost).
10. Click "Create".

### 5.4. Model Training
*   Initial training and tuning take 2-5 days (longer for large datasets).
*   Serving configs can be created before training completes but will serve "dry run" predictions.

### 5.5. Requirements for Creating a New Model (Process Summary)
1.  Import catalog and keep it updated.
2.  Record user events (follow best practices).
3.  Identify model type and optimization objective.
4.  Determine and meet user event data requirements.
5.  Import historical user events if needed.
6.  Create model and serving configs.
7.  Model training starts.
8.  Confirm model works using prediction preview.
9.  (Optional) Create A/B experiment.

### 5.6. Model Type Minimum Data Requirements (Examples)
(A detailed table is in the documentation. Below are a few key examples.)
*   **Recommended for You (CTR):**
    *   Events: `detail-page-view`, `home-page-view`.
    *   Min data: 7 days of `detail-page-view` events in last 90 days AND 10 occurrences/item avg. OR 60 days of `detail-page-view` events. 100 unique items for `detail-page-view`. 10,000 `detail-page-view` events. Similar for `home-page-view`.
    *   Window: 3 months.
*   **Frequently Bought Together (Revenue per session):**
    *   Events: `purchase-complete`.
    *   Min data: 10 occurrences/item avg. (1-year window) OR 90 days of `purchase-complete` events. 100 unique items for `purchase-complete`. 1,000 `purchase-complete` events.
    *   Window: 3 months (recommend daily event uploads).
*   **Similar Items:**
    *   Events: None required.
    *   Min data: 100 product SKUs in some branch.
*   **Page-Level Optimization:** Data requirements depend on the models selected as options for its panels.
*   **Buy it Again:**
    *   Events: `purchase-complete`.
    *   Min data: Similar to FBT but with a 90-day window for event counts. 100 product SKUs in branch.

**General Note on Data:** Use real user events and catalog data. Synthetic data doesn't build good models.

## 6. Get Recommendations (Predictions)
(Source: `https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/predict`, Last Updated: 2025-05-05 UTC)

This section explains how to request product recommendations for users based on their events and activity.

### 6.1. Before You Begin
*   Ensure you have a trained and tuned recommendation model.
*   Have one or more active serving configs associated with the model.
*   New products and user events can take up to 48 hours to be reflected in the model.
*   **Important:** Never cache personalized results for one user and show them to another.

### 6.2. Evaluate Recommendations (Preview)
*   Before site integration, preview prediction results to confirm model and serving config behavior.
*   Use the **Evaluate** page in the Search for commerce console:
    1.  Select the "Recommendations" tab.
    2.  Choose the serving config to preview.
    3.  Optionally, enter a `visitorId` for user-specific previews.
    4.  If the model type requires context (e.g., "Others You May Like" based on a product view), add associated item IDs.
    5.  Click "Prediction preview".

### 6.3. Get a Recommendation (API Call)
*   Make a `POST` request to the `predict` REST method:
    `https://retail.googleapis.com/v2/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/servingConfigs/SERVING_CONFIG_ID:predict`
*   The service account needs "Retail Viewer" role or higher.
*   **Request Body Key Fields (`PredictRequest`):**
    *   `userEvent`: (Required) A `UserEvent` object representing the user action that initiated the recommendation request (e.g., `detail-page-view` if on a product page). This event is *not* recorded by this call; it's for context only. Record it separately.
        *   `eventType`: (String) e.g., "detail-page-view".
        *   `visitorId`: (String) Required.
        *   `userInfo`: (Object, Optional) Contains `userId`, `ipAddress`, `userAgent`.
        *   `productDetails`: (Array, if applicable) e.g., for `detail-page-view`, the product being viewed.
    *   `filter`: (String, Optional) A filter string to narrow down results. See [Filter recommendations](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/filter-recs).
    *   `params`: (Object, Optional) Key-value pairs for per-request settings.
        *   `priceRerankLevel`: (String) e.g., "price-rerank-enabled", "price-rerank-disabled". Overrides serving config setting.
        *   `diversityLevel`: (String) e.g., "diversity-low", "diversity-medium", "diversity-high". Overrides serving config setting.
    *   `validateOnly`: (Boolean, Optional) If true, validates the request without returning predictions.
    *   `pageSize`: (Integer, Optional) Number of recommendations to return.
    *   `pageToken`: (String, Optional) For pagination.
    *   `labels`: (Map, Optional) Key-value labels for the request, useful for analytics.

*   **Example `curl` for `predict`:**
    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
        --data '{
                  "userEvent": {
                      "eventType": "detail-page-view",
                      "visitorId": "VISITOR_ID",
                      "productDetails": [{"product": {"id": "PRODUCT_ID"}}]
                  }
                }' \
    https://retail.googleapis.com/v2/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/servingConfigs/SERVING_CONFIG_ID:predict
    ```

*   **Response (`PredictResponse`):**
    *   `results`: An array of `PredictResponse.PredictionResult` objects, each usually containing just the `id` of the recommended product.
        ```json
        {
          "results": [{"id": "sample-id-1"}, {"id": "sample-id-2"}],
          "attributionToken": "sample-atr-token"
        }
        ```
    *   `attributionToken`: (String) **Crucial.** This token must be associated with any URL served as a result of this prediction and returned with subsequent user events related to those recommendations. See [Attribution Tokens](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/attribution-tokens).
    *   `missingIds`: (Array of Strings, Optional) IDs of products in the request that were not found in the catalog.
    *   `validateOnly`: (Boolean) True if the request was a validation-only request.

### 6.4. Features

#### 6.4.1. Price Reranking
*   Orders recommended products with similar probability by price (highest first). Relevance is still a primary factor.
*   Can be set at the serving config level or per-prediction request via `PredictRequest.params.priceRerankLevel`.

#### 6.4.2. Recommendation Diversity
*   Affects whether results from a single request are from different product categories.
*   Can be set at the serving config level or per-prediction request via `PredictRequest.params.diversityLevel`.

#### 6.4.3. Recommendation Filters
*   Use the `filter` field in `PredictRequest` to narrow results based on product attributes (e.g., `filter="filterOutOfStock"`, `filter="tag=\"sale\""`).
*   Refer to [Filter recommendations](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/filter-recs) for syntax.

### 6.5. Prediction Calls with Page-Level Optimization Models
*   **Initial Call:** Make a prediction call to the serving config containing the Page-Level Optimization model. The response is a sorted list of serving config IDs (one for each panel defined in the PLO model).
*   **Subsequent Calls:** For each panel, make another prediction call using the serving config ID returned by the PLO model for that panel. This response will contain the actual product recommendations for that panel.
*   Price reranking, diversity, and filters are not available for the initial call to a PLO model serving config.

### 6.6. Monitoring and Troubleshooting
*   Set up alerts for prediction errors.
*   See [Monitor and troubleshoot](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/error-reporting).

## 7. Manage User Events
(Source: `https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/manage-user-events`, Last Updated: 2025-05-05 UTC)

This section covers viewing, rejoining, and removing user events. For recording real-time events or importing historical events, see their respective documentation sections.

### 7.1. View Aggregated User Event Information
*   Event integration metrics can be viewed on the **Events** tab of the Search for commerce console **Data** page.
*   Shows events written or imported in the last year.
*   Metrics can take up to 24 hours to appear after ingestion.

### 7.2. Rejoin User Events
*   **Purpose:** Links specified user events with the latest version of the product catalog. This is particularly useful for "unjoined" events (events associated with a product not in the catalog at ingestion time) or to correct events joined with an outdated catalog.
*   **API Method:** `POST` request to `https://retail.googleapis.com/v2/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/userEvents:rejoin`
*   **Permissions:** Requires "Retail AI Admin" IAM role.
*   **Duration:** Can take hours or days to complete.
*   **Request Body (`RejoinUserEventsRequest`):**
    *   `userEventRejoinScope`: (String) Specifies which events to rejoin.
        *   `USER_EVENT_REJOIN_SCOPE_UNSPECIFIED`: Default. Rejoins both joined and unjoined events.
        *   `JOINED_EVENTS`: Rejoins only events that were previously joined.
        *   `UNJOINED_EVENTS`: Rejoins only unjoined events.
*   **Example `curl` for rejoining unjoined events:**
    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
        --data '{
         "userEventRejoinScope": "UNJOINED_EVENTS"
         }' \
        "https://retail.googleapis.com/v2/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/userEvents:rejoin"
    ```
*   **Response:** An operation object. The status can be checked by GETting the operation URL. A successful rejoin response includes `rejoinedUserEventsCount`.

### 7.3. Remove User Events (Purge)
*   **General Recommendation:** Generally, leave user events in place. Purging is not recommended. Consider creating a new project for a full reset.
*   **Purpose:** To remove improperly recorded user events.
*   **API Method:** `POST` request to `https://retail.googleapis.com/v2/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/userEvents:purge`
*   **Duration:** Can take several days.
*   **Request Body (`PurgeUserEventsRequest`):**
    *   `filter`: (String) A filter string to specify which events to remove. Supports filtering on `eventTime`, `eventType`, `visitorID`, and `userID`.
    *   `force`: (Boolean)
        *   `false` (default): Dry run. Returns the count of events that *would* be deleted without actually deleting them.
        *   `true`: Actually deletes the events. **Use with caution as this cannot be undone.**
*   **Filter String Syntax:**
    *   `eventTime > "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"` or `eventTime < "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"` (RFC 3339 Zulu time). Can be specified once or twice for a contiguous block.
    *   `eventType = "event-type-name"`
    *   `visitorID = "some-visitor-id"`
    *   `userID = "some-user-id"`
    *   Multiple restrictions are ANDed.
    *   Example: `filter="eventTime > \"2019-12-23T18:25:43.511Z\" eventTime < \"2019-12-23T18:30:43.511Z\" eventType = add-to-cart"`
*   **Example `curl` for dry run:**
    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
      --data '{
        "filter":"eventTime > \"2019-12-23T18:25:43.511Z\" eventTime < \"2019-12-23T18:30:43.511Z\"",
        "force":"false"
      }' \
      "https://retail.googleapis.com/v2/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/userEvents:purge"
    ```
    *   **Response:** An operation object. A successful purge response includes `purgedEventsCount`.

## 8. Manage Catalog Information
(Source: `https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/manage-catalog`, Last Updated: 2025-05-01 UTC)

This section describes how to manage product information after the initial catalog import. While full catalog re-imports are common for updates, individual product management is also possible.

### 8.1. CRUD Operations for Individual Products
These operations are typically done via the REST API.

#### 8.1.1. Create a Product
*   **Method:** `POST` to `https://retail.googleapis.com/v2/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/0/products?productId=PRODUCT_ID`
*   **Request Body:** A `Product` JSON object (e.g., `{"title": "PRODUCT_TITLE", "categories": "CATEGORY"}`).
*   **Response:** The created `Product` object.
*   **API Reference:** `products.create`

#### 8.1.2. Retrieve (Get) a Product
*   **Method:** `GET` to `https://retail.googleapis.com/v2/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/0/products/PRODUCT_ID`
*   **Response:** The `Product` object.
*   **API Reference:** `products.get` (though the doc shows the endpoint for `list` or `get` by name)

#### 8.1.3. Update a Product
*   **Method:** `PATCH` to `https://retail.googleapis.com/v2/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/0/products/PRODUCT_ID?updateMask=title,description`
*   **Request Body:** A partial `Product` JSON object containing fields to update.
*   `updateMask`: (Query parameter) Comma-separated list of fields to update (e.g., `title`, `priceInfo.price`).
*   **Response:** The updated `Product` object.
*   **API Reference:** `products.patch`

#### 8.1.4. Delete a Product
*   **Method:** `DELETE` to `https://retail.googleapis.com/v2/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/0/products/PRODUCT_ID`
*   **Recommendation:** Instead of deleting, set product `availability` to `OUT_OF_STOCK` to preserve historical data for model quality. Deleting products referenced by user events can cause issues.
*   **API Reference:** `products.delete`

### 8.2. View Aggregated Catalog Information
*   Use the **Catalog** tab on the **Data** page in the Search for commerce console.
*   Allows viewing aggregated information and previewing uploaded products.

### 8.3. Assess Catalog Data Quality
*   Use the **Data quality** page in the Search for commerce console.
*   Helps identify if catalog data needs updates to improve search results and unlock performance tiers.
*   Refer to [Unlock search performance tiers](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/data-quality) and [Catalog quality metrics](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/catalog#quality-metrics).

### 8.4. Change Product Types
*   Product types: `TYPE_UNSPECIFIED`, `PRIMARY`, `VARIANT`, `COLLECTION`.
*   If a product's type changes or was incorrect, it must be deleted and then re-created with the updated type.

### 8.5. Change Product Level Configuration (Primary/Variant for Merchant Center Imports)
*   Applies when product levels (primary/variant) for Merchant Center imports need correction.
*   Requires "Retail Admin" IAM role.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Ensure no imports are active.
    2.  Delete all product items from the catalog branch (`products.delete`). The catalog must be empty.
    3.  Re-import data, correctly setting the product level configuration during the import process (refer to "Import Catalog Information" docs).
    4.  Finish importing the new catalog.
    5.  Tune all existing models manually via the Models page in the console.

## 11. REST API Reference Overview
(Source: `https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/reference/rest`, Last Updated: 2025-03-08 UTC)

This section provides an overview of the Vertex AI Search for commerce REST API structure. The API allows for direct interaction with the service for managing resources and operations.

### 11.1. API Versions and Discovery
*   The API is versioned, with `v2`, `v2alpha`, and `v2beta` being common.
    *   `v2` is generally the stable version.
    *   `v2alpha` and `v2beta` offer access to newer features that might still be under development or subject to change.
*   **Service Endpoint:** `https://retail.googleapis.com`
*   **Discovery Documents:** Available for each version (e.g., `https://retail.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version=v2`) for machine-readable API specification.

### 11.2. Key Resource Categories
The REST API is organized around resources. Common high-level resources include:
*   **`projects`**: Top-level project configuration (e.g., `alertConfig`, `loggingConfig`).
*   **`projects.locations.catalogs`**: Manages catalogs, default branches, attribute configurations, completion configurations, and analytics.
    *   **`projects.locations.catalogs.branches.products`**: Core resource for managing products within a catalog branch (create, get, list, patch, delete, import, export, setInventory, add/remove local inventories).
    *   **`projects.locations.catalogs.userEvents`**: For managing user events (collect, import, write, purge, rejoin).
    *   **`projects.locations.catalogs.models`**: For creating and managing recommendation models (create, get, list, patch, pause, resume, tune).
    *   **`projects.locations.catalogs.servingConfigs`**: For managing serving configurations that link models/controls to placements (create, get, list, patch, delete, predict, search, add/remove controls).
    *   **`projects.locations.catalogs.controls`**: For managing controls that influence search/recommendation results.
    *   **`projects.locations.catalogs.operations` / `projects.locations.catalogs.branches.operations`**: For checking the status of long-running operations.
    *   **`projects.locations.catalogs.placements`**: Alternative endpoint for `predict` and `search` using a placement ID (often tied to a serving config).

### 11.3. Common API Interaction Patterns
*   **Resource Names:** Resources are identified by a path, e.g., `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/0/products/PRODUCT_ID`.
*   **Standard Methods:**
    *   `GET`: Retrieve a resource.
    *   `POST`: Create a resource or invoke a custom method (like `import`, `predict`, `search`, `rejoin`).
    *   `PATCH`: Update a resource (often with an `updateMask` to specify fields).
    *   `DELETE`: Delete a resource.
    *   `LIST`: List resources under a parent.
*   **Long-Running Operations (LROs):** Many operations like import, export, model tuning are LROs. The initial API call returns an operation name, which can then be polled (e.g., via `projects.locations.catalogs.operations.get`) until `done: true`.

### 11.4. Navigating the Full Reference
*   The main REST reference page (`https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/reference/rest`) provides direct links to the detailed documentation for each resource and method under each API version (`v2`, `v2alpha`, `v2beta`).
*   Developers should consult these detailed pages for specific request/response bodies, query parameters, and field descriptions when implementing API calls. For example, to find details for creating a product, one would navigate to the `v2.projects.locations.catalogs.branches.products` resource and look for the `create` method.

This overview serves as a map to the extensive REST API. For specific endpoint details, always refer to the linked pages for the relevant API version.

## 12. RPC API Reference Overview
(Source: `https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/reference/rpc`, Last Updated: 2025-03-08 UTC)

This section provides an overview of the Vertex AI Search for commerce RPC (Remote Procedure Call) API structure, typically used with gRPC.

### 12.1. Service Name
*   The primary service name for creating RPC client stubs is `retail.googleapis.com`.

### 12.2. API Versions
*   The RPC reference also covers multiple API versions, primarily `v2`, `v2alpha`, and `v2beta`.
*   Developers should choose the version appropriate for their needs (stability vs. access to newer features).

### 12.3. Key Services
The RPC API is organized into services, each grouping related methods. The main services correspond closely to the functionalities offered by the platform:

*   **`google.cloud.retail.v2.AnalyticsService`**: For exporting analytics metrics.
*   **`google.cloud.retail.v2.CatalogService`**: Manages catalogs, attributes configuration, completion configuration, and default branches.
*   **`google.cloud.retail.v2.CompletionService`**: For autocompletion features (e.g., `CompleteQuery`, `ImportCompletionData`).
*   **`google.cloud.retail.v2.ControlService`**: Manages controls for search and recommendations.
*   **`google.cloud.retail.v2.ModelService`**: For creating, managing, and tuning recommendation models.
*   **`google.cloud.retail.v2.PredictionService`**: For getting recommendation predictions (`Predict` method).
*   **`google.cloud.retail.v2.ProductService`**: For managing individual products (CRUD operations, inventory updates, import/export).
*   **`google.cloud.retail.v2.SearchService`**: For performing searches (`Search` method).
*   **`google.cloud.retail.v2.ServingConfigService`**: Manages serving configurations.
*   **`google.cloud.retail.v2.UserEventService`**: For ingesting and managing user events.
*   **`google.cloud.retail.v2alpha.*` and `google.cloud.retail.v2beta.*`**: These namespaces contain services and methods for alpha and beta features, respectively. They often mirror the `v2` services but may include additional or modified functionalities (e.g., `BranchService`, `ConversationalSearchService`, `MerchantCenterAccountLinkService` in `v2alpha`).
*   **`google.longrunning.Operations`**: Standard service for managing long-running operations (like imports, model tuning).
*   **`google.cloud.location.Locations`**: For getting and listing supported locations.

### 12.4. Using the RPC Reference
*   The main RPC reference page (`https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/reference/rpc`) lists each service and its methods for each API version.
*   Unlike the REST reference which links to detailed pages for each resource, the RPC reference page itself contains the list of methods for each service.
*   For detailed message definitions (request/response protobufs) and specific gRPC service definitions, developers would typically refer to the `.proto` files provided by Google or the generated code from client libraries.

This overview provides a structural understanding of the RPC API. For specific method signatures and message types, developers using gRPC would consult the relevant `.proto` definitions or the client library documentation for their chosen language.

## 16. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
(Source: `https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/faq`, Last Updated: 2025-04-17 UTC)

This section summarizes common questions about Vertex AI Search for commerce.

### 16.1. General
*   **Client Libraries & Sample Code:** Yes, client libraries are available (see Section 10). Google API Discovery Service can also be used.
*   **Model Personalization:** "Recommended for You," "Others You May Like," and "Buy it Again" models are personalized if user history is provided. "Frequently Bought Together" and "Similar Items" are not.
*   **Personalization Immediacy:** Recommendations improve with more user history. Models start taking user behavior into account immediately if real-time events are sent. Batch-uploaded events are less effective for immediate personalization.
*   **Demographic Data:** Models use only catalog and user event data you provide. Demographic data can be included as custom attributes (anonymized, no PII).
*   **Group Recommendations:** Currently based on single visitor/user ID. For group recommendations, make individual requests and combine, or use group IDs as user IDs if common metadata exists.
*   **Product Images:** Image URLs in catalog are for metadata retrieval and rendering, not currently used by models for recommendations.
*   **Non-Retail Use Cases:** While designed for retail, some customers use it for content, video, gaming. However, features are retail-focused.
*   **Placement of Recommendations:** Models are designed for specific pages (e.g., FBT on add-to-cart, OYML on product detail, RFY on home page).
*   **Email Newsletters:** Yes, by calling the API with a visitor/user ID and incorporating results into email templates. Dynamic loading at read-time requires an intermediary (e.g., Cloud Function).
*   **Non-Web Use Cases (Mobile, Kiosks):** Yes, by setting up an endpoint (e.g., Cloud Function) to get results and send events.
*   **Insufficient Event Data:** "Similar Items" model doesn't require event data. Other models can be trained with recent real-time events if historical data is lacking, but quality improves with more data (ideally 3+ months of views/adds-to-cart, 1-2 years of purchases for FBT).
*   **Category Recommendations:** Only product recommendations are returned, but categories for each product can be included in results.
*   **Data Integrations (SQL, BigQuery):** Yes, sample code exists for reading from BigQuery. GA sample dataset for BigQuery is available.
*   **Cookies:** Vertex AI Search for commerce itself doesn't use cookies, but requires a `visitorId` which is often a session ID from a cookie.
*   **Dedicated Project:** Not required; can enable in an existing project.
*   **Credential Issues (Cloud Shell):** Ensure proper authentication setup with a service account.
*   **Comparing Solutions:** Use A/B tests.
*   **Feature Requests:** Submit via account team, Google Support, or issue tracker.

### 16.2. Catalogs and Products
*   **Cold Starts (New Products):** Recommendations based on similar products (good titles, categories, descriptions are important). For cold-start users, popular products are shown initially, personalizing as events come in.
*   **Merchant Center Catalog:** Can be used by exporting to BigQuery via MC Data Transfer Service.
*   **Other Catalog Import Methods:** BigQuery, Cloud Storage (JSONL), Inline API call, `Products.create` method.
*   **Keeping Catalog Updated:** Daily updates recommended (full or incremental). Real-time price/availability updates are ideal. Cloud Scheduler can automate imports.
*   **Catalog Size:** No minimum, but <100 items may see little benefit. Max is 40 million items (check quotas for specifics if search is enabled).
*   **Multiple Countries/Websites:**
    *   Usually best to have one catalog if significant product overlap. Use "entities" or filter tags for site-specific results.
    *   Separate projects if catalogs/languages are very different or if traffic is low on secondary sites (to ensure enough events for model quality on main site).
    *   Consistent item IDs across sites are crucial for a single catalog.
*   **Multiple Currencies:** Not supported per catalog. All events must use a single currency. Convert before uploading if using console revenue metrics.
*   **Cross-Site Recommendations (Shared Catalog):** Recommended if significant overlap. Use entities or filter tags. Separate projects for dissimilar catalogs.
*   **Metadata for Model Improvement:** Primary fields: ID, title, category hierarchy, price, URL. Custom key-value attributes in `Product.attributes[]` can also be used. Image URLs are mainly for rendering/preview.
*   **Supported Languages:**
    *   Recommendations: Most languages (auto-detects).
    *   Search: Specific list of world languages.
    *   Catalog should be in one language; queries in the same language.
*   **Primary/Variant SKUs:** Supported (similar to `item_group_id` in MC). Define product level (parent/child) before sending data. Changing levels requires rejoining/retuning. See [Product levels](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/catalog#product-levels).
*   **Deleting Unavailable Products:** Recommended to set `availability` to `OUT_OF_STOCK` instead of deleting, to preserve historical event data.

### 16.3. User Events
*   **Required Event Types:** See [About user events](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/user-events) and [User event data requirements](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/create-models#import-reqs).
*   **Troubleshooting Data Quality:** Use **Data Quality** page in the console.
*   **Google Analytics 360 Integration:** Historical data via BigQuery export. Real-time via GTM pixel recommended due to GA360 delays.
*   **GA360 Event Coverage:** Natively supports most events except `search` (which is constructed from queries and impressions).
*   **Feeding Events:** Cloud Storage, API inline import, JS Pixel, GTM, API `write` method.
*   **Missing Event Types/Values:** Refer to minimum requirements per model. More events/item generally better. Default quantity to 1 if unknown. `displayPrice` should always be set.
*   **Limited Event Types:** Check minimum data requirements for specific models.

### 16.4. Search Results
*   **Personalization:** Yes, based on `visitorId`.
*   **Context (e.g., Store ID):** Send as product attributes and use in search request parameters for filtering/ranking.
*   **Hiding Products:** Use `filter` parameter with tags.
*   **Ranking on Multiple Criteria:** Yes, `boostSpec` allows complex ranking rules.
*   **Grouping Attributes (Facets):** Product attributes are not hierarchical. Use multiple custom attributes (e.g., country_of_production, city_of_production).
*   **Suggestions (Autocomplete):** Combination of user queries, rewritten queries, product names. Requires sufficient search events and catalog.

### 16.5. Prediction Results
*   **Limit on Predictions Returned:** Default 20. Max 100 via `pageSize` parameter. More requires Google Support (can increase latency).
*   **Reasons for Recommendations:** Not provided.
*   **Caching Predictions:** Not recommended due to real-time improvements and daily model retraining.
*   **Re-ranking Results (Business Rules):** Supported, but can reduce model effectiveness. Price reranking is a built-in option.
*   **Filter Tag Limits:** No hard limit on unique tags. Recommended max 10 tags/item. Total tags limit 100M (sum of all per-item tag counts).
*   **Diversification:** Yes, via serving config or predict request params. Balances category diversity and relevance.
*   **Prioritize by Price:** Yes, "Price reranking" feature.

### 16.6. Models
*   **"Model not ready" Error:** Usually means model hasn't finished training. Contact support if >10 days.
*   **Training Time:** Initial: 2-5 days (longer for large datasets). Retrains daily unless disabled.
*   **Download/Export Model:** No.
*   **Use Models in New Project:** No, must recreate and retrain.
*   **Category Page Recommendations:** Yes, use "Recommended for You" model with filter tags for the specific category. Disable diversity.
*   **Disable Personalization:** Not recommended. Possible by sending random unique `visitorId` for specific serving configs.

### 16.7. Console Usage
*   **Purged Events Still Showing in Dashboard:** Expected. Dashboard shows ingested events over time, not current count.
*   **Identifying Catalog/Event Errors:** API calls return errors. Dashboard shows unjoined event percentage. Use Cloud Monitoring/Logging.
*   **Inactive Recommendation Serving Configs:** Model needs to be trained with catalog/event data first.
*   **Revenue Metrics Currency:** Reported in the currency used in uploaded data. Single currency per catalog recommended.
