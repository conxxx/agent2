    # For Gemini API (ai.google.dev), you directly instantiate GenerativeModel
    # and the API key is usually configured via an environment variable `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
    # or by passing `transport='rest'` and `credentials` to `GenerativeModel` if not using env var.
    # The `genai.configure()` method is not the standard way for the `google-genai` package
    # when using the Gemini API directly (not Vertex AI).
    # The API key is typically picked up from the environment variable GOOGLE_API_KEY.
    # If it's not set, `genai.GenerativeModel` will raise an error.
    # We've already set API_KEY, so we'll ensure it's used if GOOGLE_API_KEY env var isn't set.
    # However, the most straightforward way if API_KEY is in a variable is to use it with `configure`
    # if that were the correct method, or pass it to the model if the model took it.
    # Let's stick to the direct `GenerativeModel` instantiation which relies on `genai.configure`
    # or environment variables.

    # Ensure API_KEY is set for genai.configure if it's to be used.
    # The previous error "module 'google.genai' has no attribute 'configure'"
    # indicates that `genai.configure` is indeed not available directly on the `genai` module.
    # The configuration is typically done when creating a `Client` instance for Vertex AI,
    # or by setting the GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable for the Gemini API.

    # Given the error, it seems `genai.configure` is not the way for the direct Gemini API.
    # The API key should be set as an environment variable `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
    # If we must use the API_KEY variable, we might need to use a different initialization
    # or ensure the environment variable is set.

    # Let's assume the environment variable GOOGLE_API_KEY should be set.
    # If not, the GenerativeModel() call will fail.
    # The user has provided API_KEY in the script, so we should try to use that.
    # The `google-generativeai` package (older) used `genai.configure(api_key=...)`.
    # The `google-genai` package (newer, which we are using) for direct Gemini API
    # expects `GOOGLE_API_KEY` env var, or for Vertex AI, a `Client` object.

    # Re-checking documentation for `google-genai` for direct API key usage without Vertex Client.
    # The `google-genai` PyPI page shows:
    # from google import genai
    # client = genai.Client(api_key='GEMINI_API_KEY') # This is for the *Gemini Developer API*
    # And then model = client.models.generate_content(...)
    # OR
    # export GOOGLE_API_KEY='your-api-key'
    # from google import genai
    # model = genai.GenerativeModel(...)

    # The script was trying `genai.configure` which was wrong for `google-genai`.
    # Then it tried `client = genai.Client(api_key=API_KEY)` and `model = client.models.GenerativeModel(MODEL_NAME)`
    # which led to `AttributeError: 'Models' object has no attribute 'GenerativeModel'`.
    # This implies `client.models` does not directly have `GenerativeModel`.

    # Let's try the direct `genai.GenerativeModel` approach, ensuring the API key is set
    # via the environment if `genai.configure` is truly not part of this version of `google-genai`.
    # The PyPI page for `google-genai` (version 1.15.0, close to our 1.14.0)
    # shows `genai.configure(api_key=YOUR_API_KEY)` as a valid way to set the key
    # for the Gemini API (non-Vertex).
    # The error "module 'google.genai' has no attribute 'configure'" is puzzling if the docs are current.
    # Let's assume the docs are correct and there might be an environment issue or a subtle version difference.

    # If `genai.configure` is not found, the alternative is to ensure `os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = API_KEY`
    # before `genai.GenerativeModel` is called.

    # Given the persistent `AttributeError: module 'google.genai' has no attribute 'configure'`,
    # it's highly likely that `genai.configure` is NOT the correct method for this version/setup.
    # The most robust way for the Gemini API (non-Vertex) is to set the environment variable.
